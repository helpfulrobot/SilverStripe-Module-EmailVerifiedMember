## Introduction

This module provides a mechanism that requires users to verify their email address before they can log on to the CMS.

Optionally: after adding moderators new user registrations have to be confirmed before they can be log on. Moderators receive email on registration.

This works with custom registration forms and the forum.

## Requirements

 * SilverStripe Trunk

## Installation

See docs/en/Installing.md
